# value is soul

*ask me of time, and watch me move and vanish in white smoke*

---

there was never a place in my life that escaped deceipt. we are incapable of truth, so we escape to machines, the only 3rd-party by which humans can keep their irresponsible lizard-side of their brain in check. can we no longer abide by false laws, compelled lifestyles, and can we not rid ourselves of the anchors, that prevent us from transcending ourselves as valuable human beings.

i am not interested in your mislead concepts of utopia, and if you think it's all about that, then remember, child, there is nothing false about following the path towards it. only those who discount it are the ones who have given up on us.
