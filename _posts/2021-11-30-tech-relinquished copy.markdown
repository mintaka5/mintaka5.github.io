Today, is the day that I am no longer providing new found skills to a workforce that states that it needs them, but does in no way provide a healthy environment for those of us who need to build, create, innovate, or simply be acknowledged by larger society as the builders of a new age. Instead we are shunted to the dark corners of a disease we call capitalism. A failed economic structure that enables miscommunication, misdeeds, misinformation, malicious intent, and simply anything that was a worthwhile information resource on the internet has been scrubbed away in the name of what? A virtual currency chased by a growing population of people that only understand that it has the potential to make them rich and nothing else beyond that. 

I no longer love code. It is a burden. It has decreased my value. It has provided no means of growth. It fails to find a way to provide good information, in world that could care less about the failure of being informed and data-centric. Nope. The world is only interested in money. A money that is not backed by any value whatsoever.

Goodbye, dev community.

VALUE IS SOUL!
