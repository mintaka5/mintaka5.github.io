I awoke to a very satisfying Reddit post this morning regarding what the media has now renamed the "the great resignation" to now ["the great revolt"](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/397361).

I won't get into the politics of it, and I wholly support a movement of workers that have decided that there is not a single shread of evidence out there that will prove to us that the economic powers that be, have any interest in enabling our society as a whole to thrive, prosper, and, I even dare say, to sustain itself.

Not a single individual on this planet deserves the lack of economic safety and assurance that current economic leaders have failed to provide, not just in recent debacles (a la COVID), but for what seems multiple generations, and this lousy Entrepreneur article just goes to show that business leaders and economic leaders have little to no interest in joining those of us that have awoken, and made the paradigm shift, but instead they have chosen to simply rewrite the lie,  that script which is really jsut a one-sided contract that continues to unreasonably benefit only them. They don't wish to create value for all, just ensured that their greed will continue to be fed off the backs of those stifled by a lack of prosperity. The rich are stealing from us and calling us lazy and greedy.

Not convinced yet? Let's look at the numbers of money that was poured liberally into the Mddle East wars. There was no problem paying for that! Wht was the result? Many very happy rich oil executives, rubbing their hands together while they slowly siphon trillions of dollars out of our tax dollars, to fight a war for 20 years, that didn't change anything. 

How about the trillions of dollars poured into healthcare? Where has all of that gone? Insted of investing in your people, you've decided to wage a useless war, feed a financial industry that is never satisfied, and enable only those mechanisms that appease the masses, silo them from economic participation, and keep pushing that quality-of-life bar down into the depths of hell!

It doesn't work! Until it does, we should all revolt against a very broken social contract.

VALUE IS SOUL!
