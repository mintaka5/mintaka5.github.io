What is value to you. In my over 2 decades of programming, I've come to learn that 
the process by which we implement our little tidbits of knowledge creation, exchange, and trust, we simutaneously fail to recognize the value in the things we create. Instead of looking to existing paradigms and technologies, we should be injecting innovation with the quality of that which gives all things soul.

VALUE IS SOUL!
