## shift in thought
I know it's a simple concept, and I've read about it so many times, but control cannot be had. You can convince yourself otherwise, but it is not only intangible, but fleeting, and has no respect or regard for anyone's entitlement to it. Control cannot be had, as it can only be executed thus sacrificing it for more utilization, yet it will never be obtained, stored, accrued, or preserved. It will only be lost. The more your grasp at it the more it will pour through your mental fingertips, like sand in an hourglass (oh, and fuck time btw! but that's for another post).

A sense of control can be measured in many ways, but it should never be perceived as a mechanism by which all things get bundled, and reused like a ineffective worn out latch that has been used so many times it can no longer "control" its own function. Is this talk about programming logic here, or just existential principles?

Well, for one, do not perceive control as being exclusive to either, or anything.

Look at it as a movable object, that has no form, but lots of function. It can do all the things you so desire, but it requires a commitment, and establishment of parameters, and then it demands to be executed, sending the essence of control off into a transformative state, that will facilitate another control, and repeat this whithout ever grasping onto control, and lusting after it, to stow it away somewhere, with no purpose, lacking new knowledge of the external world. Before you know it, you've become a villain of truth, by taking control hostage, you've lost all sense of it.

## don't wear down the path
So we're throughly convinced that we need to let it go, right? Wrong! If you know that control exists, and can be utilized, and must be relinguished, in order to be utilized again. So it's a balance like everything else of obatining, experiencing, executing, and moving onto the next control. Wearing down the path still gets us to some new controls, but continuing down them alone, will be less fruitful and will provide no further knowledge. It's the best way to obtain truth, growth in value, and getting control without even having it. It's so simple, really. Kind of reminds me of [The Road Not Taken](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken) a bit.

VALUE IS SOUL!
