When was the last time you woke up, browsed the daily headlines, and said to yourself, "Wow, the world is a great fucking place to be!". I can assure you it's not been since probably my childhood, that a good news cycle has surfaced. Today, I am particularly wrestling with the concept of my anxiety in the scope of everyone elses, and how to rid ourselves of this chronic anxiety social maelstrom that cannot, yet will not, correct itself.

It's one thing to be told you're broken, and need to be fixed, but it's a whole separate social doctrine when the environment to which you are constantly exposed, and of which a product, is resistant to any and all facilities that enable people to not just produce, but to participate, and supply any one of us with dialogue of assurance, based on facts, and promoting a sustainable culture, with an embedded mechanic that enable all to to good all of the time. Instead we misinform to each other, and accept that it's the "way".

We exist at arms-length of shadowy influencers. Those that use money to sway our beliefs of what is right or wrong. To protect us from out own fears. To assure us that the wrong being done has an endless goal to eventually make the quality of life better. That's too much to ask of them.

It's not needed anymore. We don't need to be socailly baby-sat. Let us control our own destiny, instead of it being a hollow inspiration provided by overpriced advertising. Shut this factory of anxiety down, and let us live!

VALUE IS SOUL!
