## knowledge seeps
In my daily endeavours to program neat little digital machinations, I have no issues with presenting ample amounts of knowledge. Most people in the field of AI and computer sciences keep reiterating this misguided mantra, of "insufficient knowledge". This is a blunder for me. Knowledge for me is like that juncture at which there is a merging of awareness and data (constant passive input from the environment). Is this not always occurring? Consider the nature of conventional social media. Most of these companies gather huge swaths of data in order to chase the acquisition of knowledge about what it is their users do. This is basically enterprise-level knowledge sufficience. Now that I am talking about it, is this juncture constantly at the threshold of insufficiency? Maybe, because institutions desire to keep collecting, and right on the other side of that instance is the appropriate amount of knowledge.

## the cognitive battlement
So it is! When knowledge is deemed insufficient it's too late, it has become sufficient at the juncture of becoming aware of it. The mind is responsible for deciphering, filtering, digesting, and for lack of a better term decides what to do with it. Sure let's judge it as insufficient based on it's quality towards the agent using it, but while we have this conversation, more knowledge is waiting outside the walls, in order to be judged sufficient. Our brains are incapable of capturing all knowledge, so why the hell do we even bother to measure whether it is inadequate. This is our burden, as cognitive beings, is to process it, to make it knowledge. This is the cognitive battlement. The wall by which we shun all knowledge, and take just a piece and deem it insufficient. Well, yeah! SMH.

## players in statelessness
Ping-pong all day long! The battlement works in a way that it is absolutely battered with knowledge `objects` from within and without. External and internal agents are always presenting knowledge to some node or cell that works to process it. Extrapolate memory from function, and you can have a whole system dedicated to presenting various objects of intrinsic value, that will communicate stakes, in order to ensure the integrity of a node-cell or the reputation of anonymous identities/agents.
