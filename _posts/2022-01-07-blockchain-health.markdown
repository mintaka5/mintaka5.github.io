## privacy is not an absolute right
In my endeavours on the internet to help people find meaning in a digital world, I shouting at a wall with privacy pundits. I am not in support of 100% privacy protection, I also feel that loss of all our privacy is not an option either. But I don't want to complain about the existing incompetency of leadership's failure to address tracking COVID-19 cases, or how they are trying to theoretically steal our identities and ignore our privacy rights. It's all speculation anyhow. Instead I'd rather focus on Nurse Blockchain.

## vax transacts
So when we go get our vaccination, we are given a paper card issued by the CDC? Honestly, CDC? The same government that silently poured trillion of taxpayer dollars into fighting ghosts in the Middle East for 20 years, yet the CDC can't get enough money to fight a global pandemic. Seems off, but anyway, we should have a digital option. If I misplace or lose that card anyone can get my information, but if I digitally store a transaction (aka getting jabbed), the proof of the vaccination and the who got it is recorded in a public ledger with only the proof that a shot was given to patient X.

## blockchain does what
If you have abasic understanding of how the blockchain works, you'd know that it is perfect for keeping a public ledger of all transactions. The best part of that is that identifying information is left out as it is not necessary to identify a person to prove they participated in a transaction. Thus, using the blockchain to provide users with a digital signature that says "I got jabbed". No patient records, no medical ID, no history of medical care. Just a simple transaction that provides sufficent knowledge to anyone who needs it, without compromising identity or privacy.

## unique and known
Every medical ID is unique. Kind of like a public key right? So the wallet becomes the "medical card". The card ID is not the users medical identiier but some obfuscation of it thorugh hashing and or encryption. This is already handled by most blockchain technologies. It's like a Bitcoin wallet, that can be used to transact on medical treatments like vaccinations, that are small but still require a consistent consensus on who is jabbed and who is not. Even for testing. The key to the blockchain is anyone can know something without witnessing the the inforamtion, and that is perfect for presenting authoritative knowledge t oauthoritative sources without compromising an individual's privacy. The transaction is made up of a date timestamp of course, medical key (hashed medical ID), and let's say a lot number for the vaccination. Hash that, stack it into transaction blocks, build consensus, and link to the chain. On the other end, the governing entities could provide an app that is basically your medical wallet containing records of the blockchain ledger showing that your wallet is (you are) vaxed.  

VALUE IS SOUL!
