## knowledge seeps
Yep! From an earlier post, data is constantly being absorbed whether we like it or not. Not just in reference to human acknowledgement, but basically passive input to and from all things. If I want passive sources of data to/from software, that is a bit more difficult to produce, but can be manufactured quite simply. Dumb generation, or clever sourcing? Both. 

## when do you want some?
What difference does it make? If data is all around us (the "environment") time is what is insufficient to knowledge creation. It's a matter of instituting triggers to either "mine" for data, or the value of that data being passively presented is high enough to garner attention, because the value means something to the receiver. Most consumers of data can and will passively assess values from passive sources. It seems that time is not a necessity in such a passive environment, because data is acquieseced forever, whenever, and spontaneously. It cannot be planned, expected, or measured externally of the receiver, and the receiver is only concerned with value not when it received it. Let's just say "if value is more pertinent to agents in this environment, then let's not make the work more dificult by the constraints of time. Time compliance is futile in the effort to attain sufficient knowledge.

VALUE IS SOUL!
