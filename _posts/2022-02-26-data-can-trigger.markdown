## knowledge seeps
Yep! From an earlier post, data is constantly being absorbed whether we like it or not. Not just in reference to human acknowledgement, but basically passive input to and from all things. If I want passive sources of data to/from software, that is a bit more difficult to produce, but can be manufactured quite simply. Dumb generation, or clever sourcing? Both. 

## when do you want some?
What difference does it make? If data is all around us (the "environment") time is what is insufficient to knowledge creation. It's a matter of instituting triggers to either "mine" for data, or the value of that data being passively presented is high enough to garner attention, because the value means something to the receiver. Most consumers of data can and will passively assess values from passive sources. It seems that time is not a necessity in such a passive environment, because data is acquieseced forever, whenever, and spontaneously. It cannot be planned, expected, or measured externally of the receiver, and the receiver is only concerned with value not when it received it. Let's just say "if value is more pertinent to agents in this environment, then let's not make the work more dificult by the constraints of time. Time compliance is futile in the effort to attain sufficient knowledge.

## the AI hits a data wall

So, for me, when I perceive data, especially incoming external involuntarily bound for my brain, I can't possibly reject it. Sure you could argue the grounds of emotional filtering, but yet the data from the environment is seeping in anyway. It's constantly forward, and in a very elegant way, so as to not be a brute force on the psyche. This usually is a catalyst for a byproduct like emotional filtering (the belief state), which can be a promoter of insufficient knowledge. Anyhow, boom, there's a wall of data! What do you do? Perceive it? Consider it's placement? Imagine whats on the other side? Count the bricks? Study the style of archictecture? It's not a pipeline of triggers, but more like a slow wall of thick watery medium, that will concentrate in areas, in order to provide more resources, bandwidth, performance, consensus for more crucial information (heavily weighted), and separating concentrations, as a function of distribution of information, as well as preservation (memory/archives), abstraction (cognition), and of course knowledge creation.

## future plans

Well, for now I am working on **thrity1** a software that aims to survey random strings of text, as a means to start generating knowledge from abstract randomness. To me that's really the only effective way to introduce data to an inert mind, and have it begin to understand what it's receiving from it's own generator. This is the seep to which I refer. It's a trigger layer, meant to chronically survey random junk or noise, to begin making sense of it. Including machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) queries, the plan is to query the wall of random data, and spin up a loop that begins combinating various forms of byte data (bit manipulation, random strings, hashed(random strings), encryption and signing keys, files, computational objects or documents, ....). Next step would be to, have **thirty1** begin to analyze it's own query, and use NLP to start constructing all the components to make sufficient knowledge; the ["encoding of goals, desires, intentions, and belief"](https://artint.info/html/ArtInt_36.html#belief-state-defn).
